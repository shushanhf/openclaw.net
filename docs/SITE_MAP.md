# Documentation Site Map

Use this map when turning the Markdown docs into a documentation website. It keeps the first-run path short, separates operator material from contributor material, and gives every sidebar item a stable source file.

## Suggested Landing Path

1. Start with [README.md](../README.md) for the product-level overview.
2. Send evaluators to [START_HERE.md](START_HERE.md) when they need the shortest technical orientation.
3. Send hands-on users to [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md), then [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) if they need repository context.
4. Link operators to [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md), [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md), and [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md) before any public deployment.
5. Link contributors to [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md), [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md), and [ai-contributor-guide.md](ai-contributor-guide.md).

## Build Notes

- Preserve the existing relative links when importing pages into a static site generator.
- Treat files under `docs/experiments/` as historical research notes, not primary navigation.
- Keep [docs/README.md](README.md) as the source-index page for GitHub browsing.
- Add redirects or aliases for lower-case route names if the website framework normalizes slugs.
- Keep security and contribution pages at the repository root in source control even if the website renders them under an operations or project section.
