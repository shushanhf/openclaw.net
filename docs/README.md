## Research and Experiments

The [experiments/](experiments/) directory holds time-stamped findings from specific investigations. These are frozen snapshots, not living documentation — read them when you are tracing the history of a decision (most are about the Microsoft Agent Framework AOT/JIT work).

## Doc Conventions

- Commands assume a source checkout. Replace `openclaw ...` with `dotnet run --project src/OpenClaw.Cli -c Release -- ...` when running from source.
- The supported config path is an external JSON file generated by `openclaw setup`, typically at `~/.openclaw/config/openclaw.settings.json`.
- "Posture" refers to the combined security/deployment checks surfaced by `--doctor`, `openclaw admin posture`, and `openclaw setup status`. When a doc says "check your posture", run those three.

## Missing Something?

If a doc does not answer the question you came with, that is a bug. Open a documentation issue with the exact question and the doc you read, or link to this page in a PR that adds the missing piece. See the "Getting help" section at the end of [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md#getting-help) for the full loop.
