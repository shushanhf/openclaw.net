# Dashboard Asset Build

The gateway serves Dashboard static assets from `wwwroot/dashboard`, but the Dashboard project is not a normal Gateway `ProjectReference` for static web assets. The manual copy targets in `src/OpenClaw.Gateway/OpenClaw.Gateway.csproj` avoid Static Web Assets conflicts while still materializing Blazor WASM files for local builds and publish outputs.

## Default Behavior

`CopyDashboardFiles` runs after a normal Gateway build and publishes `src/OpenClaw.Dashboard` into the Gateway output folder:

```bash
dotnet build src/OpenClaw.Gateway/OpenClaw.Gateway.csproj -c Release
```

The target copies Dashboard `wwwroot` files into:

```text
src/OpenClaw.Gateway/bin/<Configuration>/<TFM>/wwwroot/dashboard
```

It also creates non-fingerprinted `blazor.webassembly.js` and `dotnet.js` copies so the Dashboard `index.html` resolves correctly when served by `UseStaticFiles`.

## Fast Build Loops

Set `OpenClawSkipDashboardBuild=true` when a build only needs Gateway code and tests, not materialized Dashboard assets:

```bash
dotnet build OpenClaw.Net.slnx -c Release -p:OpenClawSkipDashboardBuild=true
dotnet build src/OpenClaw.Gateway/OpenClaw.Gateway.csproj -c Release -p:OpenClawSkipDashboardBuild=true
```

The CI `build-and-test` job uses this for build/test speed. Do not use it for release publish validation or any check that needs to inspect served Dashboard assets.

## Publish Behavior

`CopyDashboardFilesPublish` runs after Gateway publish and always includes Dashboard assets in the publish directory:

```bash
dotnet publish src/OpenClaw.Gateway/OpenClaw.Gateway.csproj -c Release
```

This keeps release artifacts and smoke scripts on the full asset path even when ordinary build loops opt into the skip property.

## Troubleshooting

- If `/dashboard` returns missing `_framework` files, rebuild or publish Gateway without `OpenClawSkipDashboardBuild=true`.
- If static web asset resolution fails during Gateway builds, keep Dashboard out of a normal static-web-asset `ProjectReference`; update the manual copy targets instead.
- If the Blazor boot script name changes, update the non-fingerprinted copy patterns in the Gateway project file.
